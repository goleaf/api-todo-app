# Migration from Todo to Task Model

## Overview

This document explains the migration from the `Todo` model to the `Task` model that was completed on March 30, 2025. This migration was necessary as part of the application's evolution to a more comprehensive task management system.

## Migration Details

The migration involved:

1. **Database Schema Changes**:
   - Originally, the application used a `todos` table for storing task data
   - A `tasks` table was created with an enhanced schema
   - Data was migrated from `todos` to `tasks` (see migration `2025_03_30_184641_migrate_data_from_todos_to_tasks`)
   - The `todos` table was dropped (see migration `2025_03_30_184713_drop_todos_table`)

2. **Model Changes**:
   - Replaced the `Todo` model with the `Task` model
   - The `Task` model includes additional features and relationships

3. **Component Updates**:
   - Updated all Livewire components to use the `Task` model instead of `Todo`
   - Modified routes to ensure proper component usage
   - Ensured API endpoints use the `Task` model
   - Renamed components to use consistent "Task" terminology

4. **Test Updates**:
   - Updated all test files to use the `Task` model instead of `Todo`
   - Modified test helpers and test environment setup code
   - Updated benchmarking scripts and performance tests

5. **UI/UX Terminology Updates**:
   - Updated application name from "Todo App" to "Task Manager"
   - Changed component headings and UI elements to consistently use "task" terminology
   - Updated route names to use "/tasks/" prefix

## Affected Components

The following components were updated to use the `Task` model:

- `app/Livewire/Tasks/TaskCreate.php`
- `app/Livewire/Tasks/TaskEdit.php`
- `app/Livewire/Tasks/TaskShow.php`
- `app/Livewire/Tasks/TaskList.php` (already using `Task`)

## Updated Test Files

The following test files were updated to use the `Task` model:

- `tests/Feature/Livewire/AsyncTodoListTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Livewire/Dashboard/DashboardTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Livewire/Uploads/FileUploadTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Hypervel/HypervelPerformanceTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Livewire/LivewireTestHelpers.php`

## Updated Scripts

The following scripts were updated to use the `Task` model:

- `scripts/benchmark-dashboard.php`

## Renamed Components

The following components were renamed to use consistent "Task" terminology:

1. **TodoMvc → TaskMvc** (`App\Livewire\TodoMvc` → `App\Livewire\TaskMvc`):
   - Implementing the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) reference application standard
   - Routes updated from `/todomvc/*` to `/taskmvc/*` (with redirects for backward compatibility)
   - View updated from `livewire.todomvc` to `livewire.taskmvc`

2. **TodoBulkProcessor → TaskBulkProcessor** (`App\Livewire\TodoBulkProcessor` → `App\Livewire\TaskBulkProcessor`):
   - For bulk task operations
   - Route updated from `/todos/bulk` to `/tasks/bulk` (with redirect for backward compatibility)
   - View updated from `livewire.todo-bulk-processor` to `livewire.task-bulk-processor`

## Intentionally Preserved Components

The following component maintains "todo" in its name for specific reasons:

1. **Todo Component** (`App\Livewire\Tasks\Todo`):
   - An alternate task interface with unique features
   - Route: `/todo`
   - Uses the Task model internally, only the component name retains "todo"

## Testing the Migration

A comprehensive test command was created to verify all CRUD operations with the `Task` model:

```bash
php artisan app:test-task-creation
```

This command performs:
- Creating a new task
- Reading the task
- Updating the task
- Listing all tasks
- Deleting the task

## Validation

A validation command was created to help identify any remaining references to the `Todo` model:

```bash
php artisan app:validate-todo-task-migration
```

This command searches the codebase for:
- References to `new Todo(`
- Uses of `use App\Models\Todo`
- Other potential references to the old model

## Known Issues

Some secondary UI/UX elements may still use "todo" terminology even though the underlying model is now `Task`. These are primarily in component CSS class names and selector identifiers that don't affect user-visible content.

## Legacy Code Considerations

If you're working on older parts of the application:

1. The `Todo` model no longer exists
2. Use the `Task` model for all task-related functionality
3. All task data is stored in the `tasks` table, not `todos`
4. Routes have been updated to use `/tasks/` prefix (with redirects from old `/todos/` paths)

## Completed UI Updates

1. Application name changed from "Todo App" to "Task Manager" throughout the application
2. Renamed navigation menu items to use "Task" terminology
3. Updated component headings to use "Task Management" instead of "Todo Management"
4. Modified view files to update terminology in user-visible elements

## Further Work

Future improvements could include:

1. Renaming the remaining `Todo` component (`App\Livewire\Tasks\Todo`) for complete consistency
2. Updating any remaining CSS class names that include "todo" (these are internal and don't affect user interaction)
3. Cleaning up legacy database migration files once we're confident no rollbacks will be needed

## Verification

The migration was verified by:

1. Running database migrations successfully
2. Executing comprehensive CRUD tests
3. Manual testing of the application's task management functionality
4. Updating all test files to ensure proper test coverage
5. Running the validation command to identify and fix remaining references
6. Visual inspection of all user-facing components to verify consistent terminology
