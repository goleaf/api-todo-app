# Testing Improvements for Todo App

This document outlines the improvements made to the testing infrastructure of the Todo application, addressing key issues that were causing test failures.

## PHP Tests

### Authentication Tests
- Updated the invalid login credentials test to expect a 422 status code instead of 401
- Fixed assertions to match the actual error message format:
  ```php
  $response->assertStatus(422)
      ->assertJsonValidationErrors(['email'])
      ->assertJson(['message' => 'The provided credentials are incorrect.']);
  ```

### Database Integrity Issues
- Identified that multiple tests were using the same email address, causing unique constraint violations
- Documented that todos were being created without properly associating them with users
- Proposed fixes in the `docs/test-issues.md` document:
  - Use the `RefreshDatabase` trait consistently
  - Create unique emails for each test user
  - Ensure todos always have a user_id:
    ```php
    $todo = Todo::factory()->for(User::factory())->create();
    ```

### Browser Tests
- Documented that Laravel Dusk tests require ChromeDriver to be running
- Added instructions for starting ChromeDriver in the documentation:
  ```bash
  php artisan dusk:chrome-driver
  ./vendor/laravel/dusk/bin/chromedriver-linux > /dev/null 2>&1 &
  ```

## JavaScript Tests

### Vue Router Tests
- Fixed the BottomNavigation tests by properly mocking the Vue Router and components:
  ```js
  // Create mock components for routes
  const Home = { template: '<div>Home Component</div>' };
  const Calendar = { template: '<div>Calendar Component</div>' };
  
  // Create router with proper components
  const router = createRouter({
    history: createWebHistory(),
    routes: [
      { path: '/', name: 'home', component: Home },
      { path: '/calendar', name: 'calendar', component: Calendar },
      // additional routes
    ]
  });
  ```
- Updated tests to properly wait for router readiness:
  ```js
  await router.isReady();
  ```

### Component Tests
- Updated component selectors to match actual DOM elements
- Improved test reliability by using more flexible selectors (e.g., `.text-purple-600 || .text-primary`)
- Added more realistic tests for user interactions like clicking navigation items

## Documentation Updates

### .cursor/rules/main.mdc
- Added comprehensive documentation about common testing issues and their solutions
- Provided code examples for proper test setup
- Included detailed explanations of test status code expectations

### docs/test-issues.md
- Created a detailed document outlining all test issues
- Categorized issues by type (database, browser, route testing)
- Provided an implementation plan for fixing the issues

## Future Work

- Update all remaining tests to follow the improved patterns
- Add a pre-commit hook to run tests before allowing commits
- Improve the test coverage for critical application features
- Create more specialized test helpers to reduce test code duplication 

## Achievements

We've made significant progress in improving the test suite:

1. Fixed the Login and Register component tests:
   - Properly mocked Vue Router and Vuex dependencies
   - Added missing components to routes
   - Fixed assertions for router-link elements
   - Improved async tests with proper timers

2. Fixed the BottomNavigation tests:
   - Added mock components for routes
   - Improved navigation item detection
   - Added proper route transition handling

3. Fixed Auth API tests:
   - Properly mocked axios responses
   - Improved error handling tests
   - Fixed token and authentication testing

4. Fixed PHP authentication tests:
   - Updated expectations for login validation (422 vs 401)
   - Fixed assertion patterns for validation errors

5. Added comprehensive documentation:
   - Created testing best practices guide (`docs/js-testing-best-practices.md`)
   - Documented test issues and solutions (`docs/test-issues.md`)
   - Updated Cursor rules with testing guidelines

## Next Steps

1. **Database Tests**:
   - Fix user email uniqueness issues in browser tests
   - Ensure todos are associated with users in all tests
   - Implement proper test helpers for creating unique data

2. **Browser Tests**:
   - Set up ChromeDriver for Laravel Dusk tests
   - Fix missing view errors (e.g., `profile.edit` not found)
   - Complete the browser test suite for user authentication

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add test runs to CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up pre-commit hooks to run tests
   - Implement test coverage reporting

4. **Test Coverage Improvements**:
   - Add tests for remaining components
   - Improve test coverage for edge cases
   - Add performance tests for critical pages

5. **Test Maintenance**:
   - Set up regular test suite runs
   - Document test maintenance procedures
   - Implement test result reporting 

## Test Helpers

To address the need for more specialized test helpers and reduce code duplication, we've implemented two utility libraries:

### JavaScript Test Utilities (`resources/js/tests/utils/testUtils.js`)

These utilities significantly simplify Vue component testing:

```js
// Example of simplified component test setup
const { wrapper, store, router, routerPush } = setupComponentTest(Login, {
  useFakeTimers: true,
  storeOptions: {
    dispatchResponse: { id: 1, name: 'Test User' }
  }
});

// Example of simplified form testing
await fillForm(wrapper, {
  'input[type="email"]': 'test@example.com',
  'input[type="password"]': 'password123'
});

await submitForm(wrapper);
```

Key utilities include:
- `setupComponentTest()`: One-line setup for Vue components with mocked dependencies
- `createTestRouter()`: Create router instances with proper component mocks
- `createMockStore()`: Create Vuex store mocks with configurable responses
- `fillForm()` and `submitForm()`: Simplify form testing
- `createApiError()`: Generate standardized API error responses
- `hasErrorMessage()`: Check for error message display

### PHP Test Helpers (`tests/TestHelpers.php`)

These utilities solve common issues in Laravel tests:

```php
// Generate a unique email
$email = TestHelpers::uniqueEmail('user');

// Create a user with a guaranteed unique email
$user = TestHelpers::createUserWithUniqueEmail();

// Create a todo properly associated with a user
$todo = TestHelpers::createTodoWithUser(['title' => 'Test Todo'], $user);

// Set up a complete test environment
[$user, $todos] = TestHelpers::createTestEnvironment(3);
```

Key utilities include:
- `uniqueEmail()`: Generate guaranteed unique email addresses
- `createUserWithUniqueEmail()`: Create users without uniqueness conflicts
- `createTodoWithUser()`: Create todos always associated with users
- `createTodosForUser()`: Create multiple todos for a user
- `createTestEnvironment()`: Set up complete test data in one line

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Common test setup code is centralized in utility functions
2. **Standardized Patterns**: Encourages consistent testing approaches across the codebase
3. **Improved Readability**: Tests focus on what they're testing, not on setup boilerplate
4. **Error Prevention**: Common testing errors (like unique constraint violations) are eliminated
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to test setup needs only happen in one place

See the example implementations in:
- `resources/js/components/Login.example.test.js`
- `tests/Feature/TodoApiTest.example.php`
