# Todo App API Guide

## Pure API-Based Architecture

This is a 100% pure API-based application with a service-based architecture. There are no web routes or controllers - only API endpoints. All interactions with the application must be done through the API.

### Core Components

1. **API Controllers**: Thin controllers that don't extend Laravel's base Controller class (app/Http/Controllers/Api/*.php)
2. **Services Layer**: Where all business logic lives (app/Services/Api/*.php)
3. **Request Validation**: Dedicated request classes with custom error messages (app/Http/Requests/Api/*.php)
4. **Language Files**: Store localized messages (resources/lang/en/*.php)
5. **Models**: Core data models (app/Models/*.php)

## Authentication

The API uses Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication:

1. Register: `POST /api/register`
2. Login: `POST /api/login`
3. Logout: `POST /api/logout` (requires authentication)
4. Get User: `GET /api/me` (requires authentication)
5. Refresh Token: `POST /api/refresh` (requires authentication)

All authenticated routes require a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header.

## API Workflow Loop

The API follows a complete request-response cycle:

1. **Client Request**: Client sends a request to an API endpoint with authentication token
2. **Controller**: Receives the request and passes data to a Request class
3. **Request Validation**: Validates input data with custom error messages from language files
4. **Service Processing**: Controller delegates to service for business logic
5. **Database Operations**: Service interacts with models to perform database operations
6. **Response**: Service returns a standardized JSON response
7. **Loop**: Client continues making requests as needed

## Response Format

All API responses follow this standardized format:

```json
// Success Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": { ... }
}

// Error Response
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message",
  "errors": { ... }
}
```

## Core Resources

### Tasks

Tasks are the main resource of the application.

- List all tasks: `GET /api/tasks`
- Create a task: `POST /api/tasks`
- Get a specific task: `GET /api/tasks/{id}`
- Update a task: `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`
- Delete a task: `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}`
- Toggle task completion: `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/toggle`
- Get tasks due today: `GET /api/tasks/due-today`
- Get overdue tasks: `GET /api/tasks/overdue`
- Get upcoming tasks: `GET /api/tasks/upcoming`
- Get task statistics: `GET /api/tasks/statistics`

Task model fields:
- title: string, required
- description: text, optional
- due_date: date, optional
- priority: integer, optional (1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High, 4=Urgent)
- completed: boolean, required
- user_id: foreign key, required
- category_id: foreign key, optional
- tags: json array, optional
- notes: text, optional
- attachments: json array, optional

### Categories

Categories help organize tasks.

- List all categories: `GET /api/categories`
- Create a category: `POST /api/categories`
- Get a specific category: `GET /api/categories/{id}`
- Update a category: `PUT /api/categories/{id}`
- Delete a category: `DELETE /api/categories/{id}`
- Get task counts by category: `GET /api/categories/task-counts`

Category model fields:
- name: string, required
- color: string, optional (hex color code)
- icon: string, optional (icon name)
- user_id: foreign key, required

### Users and Profiles

Users represent the application's accounts.

- List all users: `GET /api/users` (admin only)
- Get a specific user: `GET /api/users/{id}`
- Get user statistics: `GET /api/users/statistics`
- Get current user profile: `GET /api/profile`
- Update profile: `PUT /api/profile`
- Update password: `PUT /api/profile/password`
- Upload profile photo: `POST /api/profile/photo`
- Delete profile photo: `DELETE /api/profile/photo`

### Dashboard

- Get dashboard data: `GET /api/dashboard`

## Service-Based Architecture

The application uses a service-based architecture to separate business logic from controllers:

1. **Base ApiService**: Provides common CRUD operations for all resources
2. **Resource-specific Services**: Extend the base service with resource-specific logic
3. **Thin API Controllers**: Delegate to services and handle request/response
4. **Request Validation**: Dedicated request classes with validation rules
5. **Standardized Responses**: Consistent JSON response format for all endpoints

## Request Validation

All requests are validated using dedicated request classes. Custom validation messages are defined in language files:

- `resources/lang/en/validation.php` - General validation messages
- `resources/lang/en/messages.php` - Response messages

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Authentication Errors

If you encounter: "Unauthenticated"
- Check that you are sending the correct Bearer token in the Authorization header
- Token may have expired; try logging in again or refreshing token

### Validation Errors

If you encounter: "Validation error"
- Check the 'errors' field in the response for specific validation failures
- Make sure you're sending the correct data types and required fields
- For category_id, ensure the category belongs to the authenticated user

### 404 Not Found

If you encounter: "Resource not found"
- Verify the ID exists in the database
- Ensure the resource belongs to the authenticated user

## Testing API Endpoints

Use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl to test API endpoints:

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://your-api.com/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password","password_confirmation":"password"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://your-api.com/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}'

# Create a task (authenticated)
curl -X POST http://your-api.com/api/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Task","description":"This is a test","priority":2,"due_date":"2024-06-30"}'
```

# Todo API Documentation

## Pure API-Only Architecture

The Todo application is built as a 100% pure API-based system with a service-oriented architecture. This approach separates the frontend from the backend, providing a clean and maintainable codebase.

### Core Components

- **API Controllers**: Thin standalone controllers with minimal logic (app/Http/Controllers/Api)
- **Services**: Business logic is isolated in service classes (app/Services)
- **Requests**: Form validation through dedicated request classes (app/Http/Requests/Api)
- **API Responses**: Standardized JSON responses
- **Language Files**: Localized messages

### Authentication

Authentication is handled via Laravel Sanctum using token-based authentication.

- **Registration**: `POST /api/auth/register`
- **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Logout**: `POST /api/auth/logout`
- **Token Refresh**: `POST /api/auth/refresh`

### Core Resources

#### Tasks

Tasks are the central model, replacing the old Todo model.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/tasks`: List all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}`: Get a specific task
- `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`: Update a task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}`: Delete a task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/toggle`: Toggle completion status
- `GET /api/tasks/due-today`: Get tasks due today
- `GET /api/tasks/overdue`: Get overdue tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/upcoming`: Get upcoming tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/statistics`: Get task statistics

**Model Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Task title
- `description`: Task description
- `priority`: Priority level (1-4)
- `due_date`: Due date for the task
- `completed`: Completion status
- `user_id`: Owner of the task
- `category_id`: Associated category
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

#### Categories

Categories help organize tasks.

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/categories`: List all categories
- `POST /api/categories`: Create a new category
- `GET /api/categories/{id}`: Get a specific category
- `PUT /api/categories/{id}`: Update a category
- `DELETE /api/categories/{id}`: Delete a category
- `GET /api/categories/with-tasks-count`: Get categories with task counts

**Model Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Category name
- `description`: Category description
- `color`: Color code (hex)
- `user_id`: Owner of the category
- `created_at`: Creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

### Service-Based Architecture

The application follows a service-based approach where:

1. Controllers receive requests and pass data to services
2. Services contain business logic and handle operations
3. Models represent data structures and relationships
4. Responses are standardized across all endpoints

Services extend a base service that provides common CRUD operations:

```php
class ApiService
{
    use ApiResponse;
    
    protected $model;
    
    public function index(Request $request);
    public function show(int $id, Request $request);
    public function store(array $validatedData);
    public function update(int $id, array $validatedData);
    public function destroy(int $id);
}
```

### API Workflow

1. **Authentication**: Client authenticates and receives a token
2. **Request**: Client sends a request to an API endpoint
3. **Validation**: Request is validated by a request class
4. **Controller**: Minimal logic, delegates to the service
5. **Service**: Handles business logic and operations
6. **Response**: Standardized JSON response is returned

### Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent structure:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message",
  "errors": {
    // Validation errors or details
  }
}
```

### Request Validation

Validation is handled by custom request classes extending `ApiRequest`. Common validations include:

- Required fields
- String lengths
- Email formats
- Unique constraints
- Numeric ranges
- Date formats

## API Testing

The API has comprehensive test coverage to ensure reliability and functionality. The tests are organized by resource and cover all aspects of the API.

### Test Structure

Tests are located in the `tests/Feature/Api` directory and follow a consistent structure:

- **ApiTestSuite**: Overall API health check and core functionality
- **AuthApiTest**: Authentication-related tests
- **ProfileApiTest**: User profile management tests
- **TaskApiTest**: Task CRUD and special endpoints tests
- **CategoryApiTest**: Category management tests

### Running Tests

Tests can be run using the custom Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan app:run-api-tests
```

Options include:
- `--filter`: Run specific tests (e.g., `--filter=TaskApiTest`)
- `--coverage`: Generate test coverage report

### Test Coverage

The tests cover the following areas:

1. **Authentication**
   - Registration
   - Login/logout
   - Token management
   - Authorization

2. **Task Management**
   - CRUD operations
   - Task filters (due today, overdue, upcoming)

## Request and Response Flow

1. Client sends API request with authentication token
2. Request is validated by a dedicated request class
3. Controller delegates to the appropriate service
4. Service performs business logic and database operations
5. Service returns standardized JSON response
6. Response is returned to client

## Testing Strategy

The API endpoints are tested using:

1. **PHPUnit Tests** - Functional tests to validate API behavior
2. **Laravel Dusk** - API automation tests
3. **API Request Validation Tests** - Testing validation rules

## Rules for API Development

1. All new functionality must be added as API endpoints
2. No web routes or traditional controllers
3. All validation must use dedicated request classes
4. All business logic must be in service classes
5. Controllers should only delegate to services
6. All responses must follow standardized format
7. Use language files for all messages
8. All models should have API-focused scopes

## Sample Request Workflow

### Registration Request

```
POST /api/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "password_confirmation": "password123"
}
```

### Registration Response

```
Status: 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "created_at": "2023-08-10T12:00:00.000000Z"
    },
    "token": "1|laravel_sanctum_token..."
  }
}
```

### Authentication for API Requests

All authenticated endpoints require a Bearer token:

```
GET /api/tasks
Authorization: Bearer 1|laravel_sanctum_token...
Accept: application/json
```

# Regex Helpers Integration

The Todo.prus.dev project includes a comprehensive set of regex helpers to simplify common regex tasks. The regex helper provides functionality for validation, extraction, and transformation of strings using regular expressions.

## Features

- **Validation Methods**: Validate emails, URLs, IP addresses, UUIDs, phone numbers, usernames, passwords, etc.
- **Extraction Methods**: Extract emails, URLs, hashtags, and mentions from strings.
- **Transformation Methods**: Slugify strings, strip HTML, and more.
- **Custom Pattern Matching**: Extract data using custom regex patterns with named capture groups.

## Usage Examples

The regex helpers can be accessed through the `Regex` facade:

```php
use App\Facades\Regex;

// Validation
$isValidEmail = Regex::isEmail('example@example.com');
$isValidUrl = Regex::isUrl('https://example.com');
$isStrongPassword = Regex::isStrongPassword('P@ssw0rd123');

// Extraction
$emails = Regex::extractEmails('Contact us at example@example.com');
$urls = Regex::extractUrls('Visit our website at https://example.com');
$hashtags = Regex::extractHashtags('Check out #Laravel and #PHP');

// Transformation
$slug = Regex::slugify('This is a test string!');
$cleanText = Regex::stripHtml('<p>This is <strong>HTML</strong> content</p>');
```

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for using regex helpers:

- `POST /api/regex/validate-email`: Validate an email address
- `POST /api/regex/extract-data`: Extract emails, URLs, hashtags, and mentions from text

# Model Scopes Generator

The Todo.prus.dev project includes a Model Scopes Generator to automatically create query scopes for Laravel models. This utility saves time and standardizes the approach to model filtering throughout the application.

## Features

- **Automatic Scope Generation**: Generates scopes based on model fields
- **Field Type Detection**: Intelligently determines field types and creates appropriate scopes
- **Customizable**: Control which fields get scopes via command options
- **Multiple Scope Types**: Creates various scope types based on field data type (string, integer, boolean, dateTime, json)

## Usage Examples

Generate scopes for a model:

```bash
php artisan generate:scopes User
```

Generate scopes for specific fields:

```bash
php artisan generate:scopes Post --fields=title,content,status
```

Include all fields, including common ones like id and timestamps:

```bash
php artisan generate:scopes Product --all
```

## Using Generated Scopes

After generating scopes, use the created trait in your model and apply scopes in queries:

```php
// In your model:
use App\Models\Scopes\UserScopes;

class User extends Model
{
    use UserScopes;
    // ...
}

// In your controller or service:
$users = User::nameContains('John')
    ->createdAtAfter('2023-01-01')
    ->active()
    ->get();
```

# Laravel Model Info Integration

The Todo.prus.dev project includes Laravel Model Info integration to provide detailed information about Eloquent models in the application. This tool helps developers understand the structure of models, their attributes, and relationships.

## Features

- **Model Discovery**: Automatically discover all models in the application
- **Attribute Inspection**: View detailed information about model attributes including types and casts
- **Relationship Analysis**: View all relations defined on a model and their types
- **Metadata Retrieval**: Access model metadata like table names and file paths

## Command-Line Interface

The project includes a command-line interface for quick model inspection:

```bash
# List all models
php artisan model:info

# View details for a specific model
php artisan model:info User

# Show model attributes
php artisan model:info User --attributes

# Show model relations
php artisan model:info User --relations
```

## API Endpoints

Model information is also accessible via API endpoints:

- `GET /api/models`: List all models in the application
- `GET /api/models/{model}`: Get detailed information about a specific model
- `GET /api/models/{model}/attributes`: Get model attributes
- `GET /api/models/{model}/relations`: Get model relationships

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see the `docs/model-info.md` file.

# Laravel Drafts Integration

## Overview

The application integrates the Laravel Drafts package, which provides a system for creating and managing draft versions of models before publishing them. This is especially useful for content management where users might want to save their work-in-progress before making it public.

## Features

- **Draft Creation**: Save models as drafts before publishing
- **Draft Updates**: Make changes to drafts without affecting the published version
- **Publishing**: Publish drafts when ready to make them visible to the public
- **Revisions Management**: Keep track of changes with revision history
- **Preview Mode**: View drafts without publishing them

## Implementation

The Laravel Drafts package has been integrated with the following components:

- **Database**: Required database columns for tracking drafts
- **Models**: The `HasDrafts` trait added to models requiring draft functionality
- **Controllers**: API endpoints for draft management
- **Middleware**: For controlling access to drafts

## Example Model: Posts

The Post model demonstrates the implementation of drafts:

```php
use Oddvalue\LaravelDrafts\Concerns\HasDrafts;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasDrafts;
    
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'content',
        'slug',
        'user_id',
    ];
    
    protected array $draftableRelations = [];
}
```

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for working with drafts:

### Public Endpoints

- `GET /api/posts`: List all published posts
- `GET /api/posts/{slug}`: View a specific published post

### Authenticated Endpoints

- `GET /api/posts/drafts/list`: List drafts for the authenticated user
- `GET /api/posts/drafts/{id}`: View a specific draft
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post (published or draft)
- `PUT /api/posts/{id}`: Update an existing post or draft
- `POST /api/posts/drafts/{id}/publish`: Publish a draft
- `DELETE /api/posts/{id}`: Delete a post or draft

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Draft

Send a POST request to create a draft:

```
POST /api/posts
{
  "title": "My Draft Post",
  "content": "This is a draft post content",
  "publish": false
}
```

### Publishing a Draft

Send a POST request to publish a draft:

```
POST /api/posts/drafts/{id}/publish
```

### Updating a Draft

Send a PUT request to update a draft:

```
PUT /api/posts/{id}
{
  "title": "Updated Draft Title",
  "content": "Updated draft content",
  "publish": false
}
```
