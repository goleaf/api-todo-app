## Code Quality Verification

### PHP_CodeSniffer Results

Successfully ran PHP_CodeSniffer against the codebase. Found and fixed several issues:

#### Controllers
- Fixed class name in `CategoryController` (was incorrectly named `ategoryController`)
- Fixed whitespace and newline issues in:
  - `AuthenticatedSessionController.php`
  - `RegisteredUserController.php`
  - `TaskController.php`

#### Models
- Fixed class name in `Category` model (was incorrectly named `ategory`)
- Identified whitespace issues in `Todo.php` and `Task.php`

## Issues Encountered

1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - There appear to be incompatible versions between packages:
     - `nunomaduro/collision` requires `nunomaduro/termwind ^1.15.1`
     - `laravel/framework` requires `nunomaduro/termwind ^2.0`

2. **PHPUnit Compatibility Problem**
   - Errors with PHPUnit Event interfaces:
     ```
     Subscriber "PHPUnit\Event\Application\StartedSubscriber" does not exist or is not an interface
     ```

## Test Coverage

While we were unable to run the Dusk tests due to dependency conflicts, we've created comprehensive test cases covering:

- Authentication
- Task Creation
- Task Viewing
- Task Filtering
- Task Editing
- Task Completion
- Task Deletion

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts**
   - Update composer.json to use compatible versions of packages
   - Consider downgrading some packages to ensure compatibility

2. **Complete Test Runs**
   - Once dependencies are resolved, run all tests to ensure proper coverage

3. **Implement Automated Testing in CI/CD**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or similar to run tests automatically

4. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for additional features like:
     - Category management
     - User profile management
     - Calendar view functionality
